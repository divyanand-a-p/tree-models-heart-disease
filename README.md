# tree-models-heart-disease

This project uses Decision Tree and Random Forest models on the Heart Disease dataset.  
The decision tree was visualized and overfitting controlled using max depth.  
Random Forest showed better accuracy and more stable predictions.  
Feature importances were plotted to interpret model decisions.  
Evaluation included train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation.
